*"We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever." - Carl Sagan (Ch 2, [Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0375508325))*

Implementation of some common data structures and algorithms using C++11. This is mostly a recreational activity. The main purpose is to learn and to have fun. Implementations from C++ standard library and other notable libraries are almost always more preferable for production quality software.

The [references section](https://github.com/taskinoor/algorithms/blob/master/REFERENCES.md) should be consulted first before checking out a particular code.

Unit tests are present for each data structure and algorithm. Main codes are inside `alg` directory (and inside `alg` namespace), unit test codes are inside `tests` directory (and inside `algtest` namespace). There is a single `makefile` inside `tests` which can build all at once.

[Google Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) is used as unit testing framework. All codes are compiled using `g++ 4.8.4` on `Ubuntu 14.04` with warnings on. `valgrind 3.10.1` is used to check for memory related issues. The whole development environment can be found in [this Vagrant box](https://github.com/taskinoor/dev-box).
